# AIMDB
### A movie-themed app where AI and human-generated plots intertwine.
### Step into a React-powered, responsively designed chatbot application where you can converse with a friendly AIMDB manager. Your task? Determine whether movie descriptions were written by humans or generated by AI. You might be suprised! Dive straight into the IMDB website to explore further details about human-written films by simply clicking a movie poster!

This application utilizes the OpenAI API, employing a designated prompt to fetch relevant data and display it to the user along app's author supplementary data collected from IMDB.
